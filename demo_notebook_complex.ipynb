    "# Banking Feature Store Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the banking feature store with three different teams and their use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Teams:\n",
    "- **Customer Experience Team**: Customer Charter Model, Customer Behavior Prediction\n",
    "- **Risk & Fraud Team**: Transaction Type Prediction, Fraud Detection  \n",
    "- **Operations Team**: Call Prediction, Branch Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases:\n",
    "1. **Customer Charter Model**: Predict customer satisfaction and loyalty\n",
    "2. **Customer Behavior Prediction**: Predict spending patterns and financial needs\n",
    "3. **Call Prediction Model**: Predict likelihood of customer service calls\n",
    "4. **Transaction Type Prediction**: Classify transactions and detect fraud\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Demo Shows:\n",
    "- **Raw Data Exploration**: Examine actual data from Parquet files\n",
    "- **Feature Store Operations**: Apply configurations and materialize features\n",
    "- **Offline Feature Retrieval**: Get historical features for model training\n",
    "- **Online Feature Retrieval**: Get real-time features for model inference\n",
    "- **Feature Services**: Use pre-defined feature sets for different ML models\n"
